To keep our community safe, clean, and enjoyable for everyone, we have some important rules. These updates clarify how we handle home maintenance, outdoor storage, parking, pets, and more.  

### **🏡 Home & Yard Maintenance**  
- Homes, decks, porches, and sheds must meet **county and state building codes**.  
- If you’re **building something that needs a permit**, get Board approval **before starting work**.  
- Keep **grass and weeds under 9 inches** tall. Work with neighbors to maintain a clean, eco-friendly yard.  
- **Pools and trampolines** must be covered by your own insurance.  

### **📦 Outdoor Storage**  
- Your **yard, porch, or deck is not a storage area**, except for common outdoor items like:  
  ✅ Outdoor furniture, garden decorations, tools, tarps (if in good condition).  
  ❌ No junk, unlicensed vehicles, auto parts, large containers, or chemicals.  
- Stored items must take up **less than 5% of your lot** and be **hidden from public view**.  

### **🚗 Parking & Vehicles**  
- **All vehicles and trailers must be registered** and in working condition.  
- **No parking on lawns** or blocking emergency routes.  
- Your **street parking spot is for you**. Visitors should park in guest areas.  
- RVs and large trailers **must be parked in designated areas** (fees may apply).  
- **Speed limit is 10 MPH** for the safety of all residents.  
- Vehicle repairs **longer than a day** are not allowed (except minor maintenance like changing a tire).  

### **🐶 Pets**

- Certain dog breeds **or dogs with a history of aggression** are not allowed.  
- Dogs **cannot bark outside for more than 10 minutes**.  
- **Pick up pet waste immediately** in common areas and regularly in your yard.  

### **🔥 Fire Safety & Waste Management**  
- **No open burning** (no burning leaves or trash). Only **gas and charcoal grills** are allowed.  
- Trash **must be placed in dumpsters**—not left outside. Large items or construction waste must be taken to the dump.  
  



### **🚨 Rule Enforcement & Fines**

- If not corrected, fines may apply:  
  - **$25** for the first violation.
