# **Unbuilding Power: A K-12 Curriculum for Critical Awareness and Collective Liberation**

## **Kindergarten Level**
# **Unbuilding Together**

## **What This Book Is About**
This book is about how we question building.

Building is like stacking blocks, but some get more blocks than others.  
We start small.  
We question bigger.  
We learn more each time.

## **Big Ideas**

### **Stealing vs. Stewardship**
Some take more blocks, and some get fewer.  
We question who owns the block factory.  
We question who decides who gets blocks.

### **Real Sharing**
We share by making blocks equal.  
We don‚Äôt build ‚Äúyour house‚Äù but ‚Äúour world.‚Äù  
Everyone helps decide what‚Äôs fair.

### **Breaking Patterns**
Sometimes, knocking down towers is good.  
We question unfair patterns.  
We learn by making things fairer.

## **How We Unbuild**
We unbuild by:  
- Looking at who gets more  
- Asking why they get more  
- Trying equal sharing  
- Making mistakes  
- Trying again

## **Unbuilding is Fun!**
Unbuilding is like a game that never ends.  
We can always question more.  
We can always share better.  
Unbuilding helps us understand our world.

Let's unbuild together!

## **Elementary Level**
# **Patterns of Power: Questioning How We Build**

## **Introduction**
This book explores how we question building. When we see patterns, like who gets more money or power, we ask why they repeat. Just like a seed grows into a tree, our questions grow from small ideas to bigger ones.

## **Important Concepts**

### **Patterns in Control**
Patterns are everywhere in life. When we learn about fairness, we see who controls things, like money or rules. These patterns repeat in many areas:

- In money, some get richer while others stay poor.  
- In power, some obey while others decide.  
- In communities, some have more than others.

Control follows patterns that come back again and again, just in bigger ways.

### **Learning at Different Levels**
People understand control at different speeds. A good questioner knows how to show patterns so everyone can understand:

- Some need to see examples of unfairness.  
- Some need to hear how patterns work.  
- Some need to question patterns themselves.

The best questions include everyone, no matter how they learn best.

### **Feedback Loops of Exploitation**
When we question patterns, we often follow these steps:  
1. Notice unfairness  
2. Ask who benefits  
3. Share what we learn  
4. Try again

This cycle of questioning, learning, and sharing helps us see truth. It‚Äôs like a loop that keeps going around, helping us question each time.

## **Why This Matters**
Understanding patterns of control helps us become better questioners. When we know about unfair patterns, we can:  
- Question who benefits from rules  
- Share resources more fairly  
- Solve problems by asking why  
- Help others question too

Questioning isn‚Äôt just about seeing patterns. It‚Äôs about seeing unfairness, making connections, and growing our understanding in ways that repeat and challenge each other.

Let‚Äôs explore how our questions shape our world!

## **Middle School Level**
# **Systems of Capture: Understanding Power and Resistance**

## **Introduction**
Have you ever noticed how some patterns keep things unfair? This book explores how communities are shaped by systems, like rules or money, that repeat. Understanding these systems can help us question them and become better at building fairness.

## **Key Concepts**

### **Recursive Systems in Society**
A recursive system is one that refers back to itself and grows stronger. In rules, money, and communities, this means unfair patterns repeat at different levels of complexity.

For example, when learning about control:  
- First, we learn about sharing blocks (basic unfairness).  
- Then, we learn about who makes rules (power control).  
- Later, we learn about laws protecting wealth (systemic capture).  
- Eventually, we learn about wealth and power distribution.

Each level uses similar questioning patterns but applies them to bigger ideas.

### **Multi-Level Understanding**
People understand control at different levels based on their experience. Effective questioning works at multiple levels simultaneously:

- Beginners can grasp basic unfairness.  
- Intermediate learners can see connections to power.  
- Advanced learners can explore deeper systems.

This multi-level approach allows diverse learners to engage meaningfully with the same material while operating at their appropriate level of complexity.

### **Feedback and Resistance in Systems**
Communities change through cycles of questioning and resistance:

1. Notice unfair systems.  
2. Ask who benefits.  
3. Share questions with others.  
4. Push for fairer systems.

These feedback loops create spirals of deeper questioning rather than small fixes.

## **Why This Matters**
Understanding recursive systems helps us:  
- Recognize how unfair patterns connect to what we know.  
- Transfer questioning skills between different areas.  
- Adapt our resistance based on patterns we notice.  
- Develop critical awareness (thinking about our thinking).

By recognizing the recursive nature of control, we can become more effective questioners of society.

## **High School Level**
# **Recursive Resistance: Questioning Power and Liberation**

## **Introduction**
This text explores the application of **recursive patterns and critical questioning** in power and fairness. By examining how **wealth is taken, rules are formed, and communities are controlled**, we can develop more effective approaches to **fairness, sharing, and liberation**.

## **Key Concepts**

### **Recursive System Analysis in Power**
- **Distillation**: Identifying the core truths that form unfair systems, like ‚Äúownership is theft.‚Äù  
- **Amplification**: Examining how these truths create more complex control systems.

### **Fractal Resistance & Liberation Transmission**
Fairness, like questioning, can be self-sustaining when done right:  
- **Self-Similarity**: Fair systems repeat at different levels.  
- **Adaptive Resistance**: Questioning must adapt without stopping.  
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Rules and wealth must be open and questionable.

## **Why This Matters**
By understanding and leveraging **recursive patterns**, we can design **fair, collective, and liberating systems** that serve all.
