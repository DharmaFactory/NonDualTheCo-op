# NonDualTheCo-op Implementation: Final Solution

## Project Summary

This implementation creates an educational tool that teaches complex computational concepts (specifically recursive collapsibility in computational complexity) at a kindergarten reading level, following the Decision Compiler framework with recursive decision refinement. The solution is designed to serve as both an educational tool and a pitch deck for VCs who care about humanity's future, following the system architecture outlined in the repository documents.
