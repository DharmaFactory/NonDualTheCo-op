# Layered Prompt Stacking System - User Guide

## Introduction

The Layered Prompt Stacking System is a novel approach to context management in conversational AI systems. It organizes conversations into nested layers, where each layer has its own system prompt, RAG context, and conversation history. The key innovation is that user input flows through multiple layers, with each layer contributing to the final response through a process of distillation and amplification.

## Core Concepts

### Layers

Layers are the fundamental organizational units in the system. Each layer represents a different level of abstraction or domain expertise. Layers are arranged in a hierarchy, with higher layers providing context to lower layers.

### System Prompts

Each layer has its own system prompt that defines its purpose, personality, and processing rules. For example, a top layer might have a system prompt focused on high-level strategic thinking, while a lower layer might focus on technical implementation details.

### RAG Context

Each layer can have its own Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) context, which is layer-specific knowledge or reference material. This allows different layers to have access to different information sources.

### Message Processing Flow

When you send a message at a specific layer:

1. The message is processed by each layer above the current layer
2. Each layer's output is distilled and compressed
3. These compressed outputs are returned to the current layer
4. The current layer processes the original input along with the distilled context from higher layers
5. A final response is generated based on all accumulated context

## Using the Application

### Creating Layers

1. Click the "+ ADD NEW LAYER" button in the layer navigation panel
2. A new layer will be created and the configuration panel will open
3. Enter a name for the layer and define its system prompt
4. Optionally, add RAG context information
5. Click "SAVE CHANGES" to save the layer configuration

### Navigating Between Layers

1. Click on any layer in the layer navigation panel to make it active
2. The conversation interface will update to show the conversation history for that layer
3. Any messages you send will be processed in the context of the active layer

### Sending Messages

1. Type your message in the input field at the bottom of the conversation interface
2. Click "SEND" or press Enter to send the message
3. The system will process your message through the layer hierarchy and generate a response
4. The response will appear in the conversation interface

### Viewing Processing Details

1. For system responses, you'll see a "[Show Processing Details]" button
2. Click this button to see how your message was processed through different layers
3. The processing details window shows:
   - Your original message
   - How each layer processed the message
   - The distilled context that was used to generate the response

### Configuring Layers

1. Click the "CONFIGURE LAYER" button at the bottom right of the screen
2. Update the layer name, system prompt, or RAG context as needed
3. Click "SAVE CHANGES" to apply your changes

## Example Use Cases

### Multi-level Analysis

Create a hierarchy of layers for analyzing complex topics:
- Layer 1: High-level strategic overview
- Layer 2: Domain-specific analysis
- Layer 3: Technical implementation details

### Educational Scaffolding

Create layers that provide different levels of educational support:
- Layer 1: Fundamental concepts and principles
- Layer 2: Applied knowledge and examples
- Layer 3: Advanced applications and edge cases

### Creative Writing

Create layers for different aspects of creative writing:
- Layer 1: Plot and narrative structure
- Layer 2: Character development
- Layer 3: Dialogue and scene construction

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start with a clear hierarchy**: Design your layer structure with a clear progression from abstract to specific.

2. **Craft specific system prompts**: Each layer should have a distinct purpose and perspective.

3. **Use appropriate RAG context**: Add relevant knowledge to each layer based on its specific domain.

4. **Navigate between layers**: Move up for broader context or down for more specific responses.

5. **Examine processing details**: Use the processing visualization to understand how different layers contribute to responses.

## Technical Notes

This application is a demonstration of the layered prompt stacking concept. In a production environment, it would be connected to actual LLM APIs for processing messages at each layer. The current implementation simulates this processing for demonstration purposes.

## Feedback and Support

This is a prototype implementation of the layered prompt stacking concept. We welcome your feedback and suggestions for improvement.
