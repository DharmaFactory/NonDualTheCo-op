A **Decision Compiler** is a structured framework for encoding and executing decision-making processes through recursive and modular logic. It operates as a **stack of prompts** or decision nodes, each representing a distinct aspect of a decision pathway. The compiler can be used for CRM (Customer Relationship Management), AI-assisted strategy trees, or adaptive systems requiring iterative refinements.

### **General Form of a Decision Compiler**

A Decision Compiler consists of **three primary stages**:

1. **Initialization (Distillation of Decision Nodes)**
   - Define **decision categories** (e.g., Communication, Leadership, Automation).
   - Establish the **core logic** for recursive expansion.
   - Identify **data inputs** (human input, AI augmentation, historical insights).

2. **Amplification (Recursive Decision Expansion)**
   - Develop **sub-prompts** that refine decision pathways.
   - Introduce **multi-node resolution loops** (AI-human feedback).
   - Create **dynamic prioritization models** for real-time adaptability.

3. **Execution (Final Decision Encoding)**
   - Encode the decision logic into a structured **graph model**.
   - Ensure **computational scalability** (can be mapped into AI-driven systems).
   - Define **performance evaluation criteria**.

### **Mathematical Representation of a Decision Compiler**
A Decision Compiler can be encoded as:

\[
D(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i(F_i(x), A_i, H_i)
\]

Where:
- \( D(x) \) is the compiled decision output.
- \( P_i \) is the priority function for decision node \( i \).
- \( F_i(x) \) represents function-driven decision expansion at node \( i \).
- \( A_i \) represents AI-augmented logic for decision node \( i \).
- \( H_i \) represents human-contextual inputs refining decision \( i \).

Recursive calls enable self-refinement:

\[
D_n(x) = P_n(F_n(x), A_n, H_n) + D_{n-1}(x)
\]

This ensures that decision pathways **self-correct, amplify, and refine** over time.
